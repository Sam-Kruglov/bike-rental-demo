# Bike Rental Demo
A minimalistic application that has a REST API to register, rent, or return a Bike.
Starting from a simple standard MVC application, 
we very gradually introduce Event Sourcing and CQRS using [Axon Framework](https://axoniq.io/).

At any commit, the application compiles, runs, and works in the same way.

This code is a heavily modified version of [abuijze/bike-rental-demo](https://github.com/abuijze/bike-rental-demo).
The purpose of the application is to accompany my talk.
